# TestRoute - A project to create test http routes for your closest frontend or backend

## How it works

1. You run the command:

```sh
testroute
```

2. You answer some questions:

```
> What is the path of your route?: /api/user/4
> What HTTP method should listen to?: GET
> What should be the response HTTP status?: 200
> What should be the response? (Write a file path or leave empty for none): ./response.json
```

3. The server is up and running!

```
> Please test your route at: http://localhost:9999/api/user/4
```
